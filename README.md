# 42 Projects

This repository contains all the projects I have completed as part of my studies at [42](https://www.42.fr/), a renowned coding school. The projects are organized in separate folders, each corresponding to a different challenge or topic covered during the curriculum.

## Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a different project I worked on at 42. The projects are listed in the order I completed them, starting with the first one.

### Projects

- **[Libft](https://github.com/yoyoazs/42-projects/tree/main/Libft/README.md)**: A library implementation with common functions in C.

More projects will be added as I progress through the curriculum.
